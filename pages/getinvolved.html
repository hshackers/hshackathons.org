<!-- <p>When the first High School Hackers meetup was held at PennApps last year, it brought together hundreds of like-minded teenagers for the first time. Over the course a year, high school hackers made their mark, not only exhibiting hockey stick growth in their Facebook group, but also winning hackathons like MHacks. Today, we’re bringing High School hacking to the next level with the introduction of High School Hackathons, a partnership with High School Hackers that will focus on teenage hackers. Currently, High School Hackathons will display high school hackathon events and college level hackathons that admit high schoolers.
